# 🌐 CSS Styling Practice

This project is a basic HTML and CSS website where I practiced different styling techniques using CSS. It helped me understand how to style a webpage and add interactivity through hover effects.

## 🎯 What I Learned

I learned and applied the following CSS tags and properties:

### ✅ Universal Selector
- `* { padding: 0; margin: 0; }`
- Used to reset all default padding and margin.

### ✅ Navigation Bar Styling
- Background color: `black`
- Text color: `white`
- Padding: `20px`

### ✅ Inline Elements
- Elements like `ul`, `li`, and `h1` were made inline using `display: inline` for horizontal alignment.

### ✅ Margin and Hover Effects
- Applied `margin-left` for spacing between elements.
- Added `cursor: pointer` and `li:hover` with `color: red` for interactivity.

### ✅ Search Bar Design
- Center-aligned using `text-align: center`.
- Input field width set to 60%.

### ✅ Product Boxes
- Border styling with `solid black`, width: `3px`.
- `display: inline-block` for box layout.
- On hover: background turns black and text turns white.

### ✅ About and Contact Sections
- Center-aligned text.
- `contact` section styled with black background and white text.
